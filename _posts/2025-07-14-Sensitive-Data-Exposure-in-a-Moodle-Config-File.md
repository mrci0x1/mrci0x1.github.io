## Process
Letâ€™s say your target is example.com. You begin with some Google dorking using simple queries, but nothing interesting comes up.

After the initial Google Dorking yielded no interesting results, I moved on to subdomain enumeration using a reliable tool called ```subfinder```:
```shell
subfinder -all -silent -d example.com -o subfinder.txt
```
Next, I checked which subdomains were alive using ```httpx```:
```shell
cat subfinder.txt | httpx -silent -sc -probe -title -td -ip -t 90 -mc 200,404,403,302,301,303,304,305,306,307,302 -o live1.txt
```
To dig deeper, I performed subdomain enumeration on subdomains, a technique that often uncovers hidden gems. After repeating the last command, I found a few new subdomains to test, which could potentially have interesting vulnerabilities , and found this one ```https://x.x.example.com```

One of my favorite things to do is directory fuzzing. There are many great tools for this, like dirb, gobuster, or dirsearch. Personally, I prefer dirsearch because it offers valuable paths and is fast. I kicked it off with the following command:
```shell
dirsearch -u https://example.com/ -t 150 -x 403,404,500,429 -i 200,301,302 --random-agent 
```
and found many 200 OK, but there are most file interesting which called ```config.php.save```

> **Warning:** This write-up dates back to when the ```config.php.save file``` was still present. However, since the bug was resolved, the file has now been removed from the results.

Accessing the ```config.php.save``` file revealed sensitive information, such as the database username (```dbuser```), password (```dbpass```), and other critical details. This type of exposure can lead to severe security risks if not addressed.

Sometimes you wonâ€™t find anything right away, but donâ€™t let that stop you. Every step gets you closer to a win. Keep learning, stay curious, and donâ€™t give upâ€”success comes to those who keep going! ðŸŽ‰
