## 2. My Preparation — Focused, Syllabus-Driven Study

> **No INE course or paid labs were used.**  
> I studied **every vulnerability listed in the official syllabus** using **free, high-quality resources**.

### Preparation Method

1. **Reviewed the official eWPTX syllabus** and listed all vulnerability types:
   - SQL Injection
   - NoSQL Injection
   - JWT Manipulation
   - XXE
   - SSTI
   - Deserialization
   - File Upload Vulnerabilities
   - API Security
   - CVE Exploitation
   - Cryptographic Weaknesses

2. **Completed all relevant labs on PortSwigger Web Security Academy**  
   Interactive, exam-style challenges with immediate feedback.

3. **Practiced real-world exploitation on HackTheBox**  
   Targeted machines with **public CVEs** and complex web attack chains.  
   Learned exploit modification, shell stabilization, and post-exploitation.

## 3. Professional Tips for Success

- **Approach the exam with confidence** — this was my first certification; preparation matters more than experience.  
- **You are granted two attempts** — use the first to learn the environment if needed.  
- **The exam is easier than a real engagement.**  
- **Prioritize mastery of CVE exploitation, API security, and JWT manipulation** — these appear frequently.  
- **Answers are case-sensitive** — a single incorrect character or trailing space will mark your submission as wrong.  
- **Perform full Nmap scans on all targets** — provides critical version and service data for recon questions.  
- **Use only the wordlists provided in the Letter of Engagement** — they are optimized for the exam.  
- **Some questions are intentionally tricky** — verify your findings and double-check submissions before finalizing.
